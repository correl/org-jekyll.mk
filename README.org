* Org-Jekyll Publishing
** Description
   A GNU Makefile and Jekyll template for publishing a folder of
   org-mode files to the web.
** Usage
   - Add the file ~org-jekyll.mk~ to your project, then create a
     Makefile in your org folder that includes it, overriding any
     variables you want to customize:

     #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
       SITE_NAME = My Projects
       SITE_TITLE = Project breakdowns and TODOs
       SITE_BASEURL = /~userdir/projects
       SITE_AUTHOR = My Name
       SITE_AUTHOR_EMAIL = me@example.org
       SITE_GITHUB = username/project
       SITE_TWITTER = username

       include org-jekyll.mk

     #+END_SRC

   - Type ~make~ to build your site, or ~make serve~ to host it
     
   - If your org doc includes code blocks using org-babel-tangle, the
     code will be exported as well! Set the document's layout to ~org~
     to include a download link at the top of the exported page:
   
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_HTML
     ---
     title: Code Sample
     layout: org
     ---
     ,#+END_HTML

     ,* Sample Code
       ,#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle yes
         (define (fib n)
           (fib-iter 1 0 n))

         (define (fib-iter a b count)
           (if (= count 0)
               b
               (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
       ,#+END_SRC

     #+END_SRC
     
   - Setting the environment variable V to a value other than 0 will display
     the full command being run during the various build steps:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ V=1 make all
     #+END_EXAMPLE
